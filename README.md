# Surfs Up Challenge
### Unit 9 - Bryan Kuropatwa

In this project, a surfing company is exploring different weather conditions and when and where may be a good place to add a surfing stand for clients to come and surf.  As a result, one has information from weather stations around the area regarding precipitation (rain fall), temparatures observed, and well as information about the weather station itself.
